{"Drepanidae":"This group or family of moths is also known as \u201chook-tip moths\u201d, this is because the shape of their forewings tips which are usually sickle-shaped or hook-shaped. It is estimated that there are more than 950 species of moth belonging to this family worldwide, however they are predominantly oriental. Within this family there are three assigned subfamilies including Drepaninae, Thyatirinae and Cyclidiinae.\n<br><br>The adult moth size varies from small to medium with the length of the wings (wingspan) between 18-66mm. Their antennae are either feathery or thread like (bipectinate to filiform). The proboscis (mouth part) are usually absent or faintly developed. Forewings of this moth are broad and triangular with falcate (hooked) tip while the hind are mostly rounded. Their patterns are mostly shades of brown to yellow but sometimes are colourful or hyaline to white.\n<br><br>Adults are usually nocturnal and crepuscular however some are diurnal. They rest with wings \u2018roof-like\u2019 over abdomen or with wings spread. The larvae are usually arboreal feeding on leaves during the night time and resting on the rolled leaves during the day time. Many drepanid larvae have the abdomen tapering to a point and they usually rest with the head and tail raised. They make cocoons between leaves but sometimes there are no cocoons or are made inside the soil. Larval host includes a variety of species in the plant families, Anacardiaceae, Betulaceae, Rubiaceae and Caprifoliaceae.","Epicopeiidae":"This family has been placed under superfamily Geometroidea, as it has recently been described using the molecular data. This group or family of moths is also known as Oriental swallowtail moths. They are a small group of moths as there are few known species to fall under this group. There are about 25 species of moths that fall under this group, hence they are rare and hard to find. The species of this family is distributed in the Himalayan and Oriental region however some species have been found in Japan and Korea. It has two subfamilies: Schistomitrinae and Epicopeiinae.\n<br>\n<br>The Adults size varies from medium to large (36-126mm wingspan) and they look similar to butterflies due to their wings shape and colouration. Their forewings shape ranges from quadratic to triangular with somewhat pointed apical while hindwings are either rounded or with tails. Their forewings colour varies from dark brown to black with few markings. Sometimes are white with dark or coloured margins. Their hindwings colour may be similar or with coloured marginal spots.\n<br>\n<br>The adults are mostly diurnal. There is little known about the larvae however they are leaf feeders and their host plants falls under the plant families Clethraceae, Cornaceae, Ericaceae, Theaceae, Ulmaceae, Hamamelidaceae, etc. The unique feature of the larvae is that they have wax producing gland. The gland produces wax continuously and covers the body of the larvae and later also the pupae.","Zygaenidae":"This group of moths is also known as forester moths, smoky moths or burnet moths. These moths are mostly found in tropical region but some are found also in temperate region. Throughout the world there are about 1000 known species of this family. This family of moths are well studied due to their diurnal habitat, bright and colourful forms and chemical ecology. There are more than 150 known species of this family in India. This family of moth is subdivided into seven subfamilies that are Zygaeninae (burnet moths), Procridinae (forester moths), Chalcosiinae, Charideinae, Phaudinae, Anomoeotinae and Himantopterinae.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>The adult sizes vary from small to medium. The moths of this family have metallic, bright and colourful wings which vary from narrow to broad in shape and some even have hindwings with tail. They rather have clubbed shaped antennae or are either feathery or thread like. These moths do not have tapering antennae like other families of moth rather the antennae are uniformly thick. This is a unique characteristic of this family. Within this family of moth high sexual dimorphism can be seen for example the male and female are coloured differently like in the species Soritia pulchella. They commonly visit flowers as they usually have well developed proboscis. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>Adults are usually diurnal and brightly coloured. The bright colour of these moths acts as a warning to the predators that they are poisonous. Hence they are usually avoided by predators like birds. These moths when threatened discharges yellow substance from their necks which are toxic in nature. Both the adults and the larvae of these moths are toxic. The larvae are slug- like with flattened or stout body. The larvae of these moths are host specific and usually feed on angiosperm plant families. The chemical nature of these moths has also added mimicry to their characteristic. These moths lay their eggs in rows, clusters, or overlapping patches and sometimes covered with scales.","Limacodidae":"This family of moths is also known as slug caterpillar moths or hag moths. There are about 1104 known species of this group of moths in the world. This family is distributed throughout the world but diverse in tropics and oriental tropics. The subfamilies are not well established however there are two known subfamilies: Chrysopolominae and Limacodinae.\n<br>\n<br>The adult size varies from small to medium (9-80mm wingspan). They have hairy body and legs with broad and rounded wings. The head is small with robust body. The wings colour are mostly shades of grey, however some are colourful wings with few markings. The antennae are thread like, feathery or toothed and often tapering towards the end. The proboscis is small or absent.\n<br>\n<br>The larvae also called slug caterpillars feed on various species plants including crops like coffee, tea, banana, oil and coconut plants, etc. hence are also considered to be pests. Other plants include species of Rhamnaceae, Rosaceae, Leguminosae, Euphorbiaceae, etc. Instead of prolegs they have adhesive sucker bands. They are short and slug like with spiny body. The spines on their body when touched are very painful and hence it is also called nettle moths. Adults are mostly nocturnal with irregular and swift flight and while on rest they usually raise their forelegs and abdomen curled upwards. They have oval cocoons that are attached to leaves and barks. When the adult emerge, the cocoons are often left in the shape of a cup and are sometimes called \u2018cup moths\u2019.","Saturniidae":"This family of moth is also known as giant silk moths. There are more than 2000 described species of this group in the world. This group of moth is found all over the world however they are diverse in the tropical and subtropical region. Worldwide, there are nine subfamilies designated to this family.\n<br>\n<br>The adult size varies from medium to very large (60-140mm wingspan). They have a heavy body covered with hairy scales. Their wings colour is usually shades of brown with the forewings bearing window or eyespots that are triangular or concentric, hence the family name. The hind wings are rounded or with tail and often marked well than the forewings. They have short and feathery, finely branched antennae. Their mouth par is vestigial i.e. without proboscis. \n<br>\n<br>The adults are nocturnal but some diurnal like the species of subfamily Hemileucinae. Since the mouth part of the adult is vestigial, they do not feed. They rely on the energy stored during their larval stage. The adults lay eggs in clusters. The eggs have a long incubation period. The larvae have wide range of host plants preferably foliages of woody plants. The larvae are usually solitary. They have tubercles or spines on their body and are usually bright coloured or patterned. The pupae are large and covered with silk often incorporated in leaves or twigs.","Sphingidae":"This family of moth is known as Sphinx moths or Hawk moths and sometimes also bee moths or hummingbird moths. It comprises of about 1602 described species worldwide. In India there are more than 200 species of this family. It is distributes worldwide but has high diversity in the Tropical region of Asia, Africa and America. This family has three subfamilies but mostly two are assigned (Smerinthinae, Sphinginae, and Macroglossinae).\n<br>\n<br>The adults are medium to very large sized (40-140mm wingspan). They are heavy bodied moths with narrow forewings and short hindwings. The forewings colour varies from bright to darker shades with different patterns while the hindwings are usually colourful with sometimes having eyespots They have a thread like antennae with sometimes thickened or spindle shaped towards the end. They have large bulging eyes that usually lack hairs. They usually have sucking mouth (proboscis) which rare very long however are short or absent in some species.  The larvae do not have hairs on their body instead a tail like spine is present at the end of their body giving them the name hornworms. \n<br>\n<br>Moths of this family have strong wings which help them to fly swiftly. These moths are active during night and dusk but there are some that fly during the day. Many of the moths of this family mimic bumblebees and some even flies like hummingbirds hovering around the flower with which people often get confused. Hence such species are referred to as bee moths and hummingbird hawk moths respectively.  The larvae feed on wide range of plants leaves including economic plants. The larvae when disturbed make noises to scare of predators and sometimes even raise their head like that of the Sphinx of Egypt and so the name, Sphinx moth. The pupae are usually made inside the ground or under leaf litters.","Eupterotidae":"This family of moth is also known as \u2018Giant Lappet Moths\u2019 and sometimes \u2018Monkey Moths\u2019.

The forewings are broader and triangular in shape with sometimes irregular outer margin or with hooked tips. The hindwings are usually circular in shape. The colouration is usually shades of browns and grays with some markings but sometimes white like that of domesticated silk moth (Bombyx mori). The antennae are usually feathery and sensitive in nature which is used to detect and find their mates even from kilometres away.\n<br>\n<br>The adult moths are nocturnal and are usually active to find their mates, breed and lay their eggs. The moths do not have mouth parts and do not feed. They feed during their larval stage and carry enough energy to become adult, breed and lay their eggs. Hence the adult have a very short life span. The larvae are leaf feeders which have a body covered with minute hairs with a small tail like projection at the end. They predominantly feed on the host plants belonging to family Moraceae while other plants include that of Rosaceae and Ebenaceae. They pupate inside the silk cocoons.","Endromidae":"This family of moth is also known as glory moths which are found throughout the Palaearctic regions of the world.
